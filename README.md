# Project #2 Description:

Simulating Page Replacement Manager of the Operating Systems by programming the following three page replacement algorithms that we covered in the class:

- First In First Out (FIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Optimal Algorithm

The objective of this project is to help student understand how above three page replacement algorithms operates by implementing the algorithms, and conducting a performance analysis of them based on the performance measure of page faults for each page replacement algorithm using multiple inputs. Output the details of each algorithm’s execution.  You need to show what pages are inside the page frames along with the reference string and mark it when a page fault occurred.

The program will read in a reference string a file (ReferenceString.txt) – this file will be generated by you. In this project, assume that the length of the reference string is always 30 (e.g. 361724720354720146353214567012). And that there are 8 possible pages (from 0 to 7).

A sample input file with two Reference Strings:
- one having 5 page frames and a reference string 361724720354720146353214567012
- another with 6 page frames, and a reference string 454390260626389098548045079944

Example ReferenceString.txt:
```
