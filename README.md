#Project #2 Description:

Simulating Page Replacement Manager of the Operating Systems by programming the following three page replacement algorithms that we covered in the class:

- First In First Out (FIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Optimal Algorithm

You can use either Java, or C++ for the implementation. The objective of this project is to help student understand how above three page replacement algorithms operates by implementing the algorithms, and conducting a performance analysis of them based on the performance measure of page faults for each page replacement algorithm using multiple inputs. Output the details of each algorithmâ€™s execution.  You need to show what pages are inside the page frames along with the reference string and mark it when a page fault occurred.
