# Project #2 Description:

Simulating Page Replacement Manager of the Operating Systems by programming the following three page replacement algorithms that we covered in the class:

- First In First Out (FIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Optimal Algorithm

The objective of this project is to help student understand how above three page replacement algorithms operates by implementing the algorithms, and conducting a performance analysis of them based on the performance measure of page faults for each page replacement algorithm using multiple inputs. Output the details of each algorithm’s execution.  You need to show what pages are inside the page frames along with the reference string and mark it when a page fault occurred.

The program will read in a reference string a file (ReferenceString.txt) – this file will be generated by you. In this project, assume that 
- the length of the reference string is always 30, e.g. 361724720354720146353214567012
- there are 8 possible pages, from 0 to 7.  

Example ReferenceString.txt:
```

361724720354720146353214567012
6
